## Game Overview

In this game, you will compete against your opponent to reach a score of 100 first. The game involves rolling a dice, accumulating points, and dealing with a special rule: if you roll a 1 on your dice, your entire score will be halved, and the dice will be passed to your opponent.

## Rules

1. **Players**: The game is designed for two players.
2. **Objective**: The first player to reach a score of 100 wins.
3. **Rolling the Dice**: Players take turns rolling a standard six-sided dice.
4. **Scoring**: The following rules apply to scoring:
   - Each roll adds its value to the player's current score.
   - If a player rolls a 1, their entire score is halved, and the dice is passed to the opponent.
   - If a player wants to be on safe side, he/she can pass the dice
5. **Winning**: The first player to reach or exceed a score of 100 wins the game.

## Getting Started

To play the Dice Game, follow these steps:

1. Gather two players.
2. Each player takes turns rolling the dice and accumulating points.
3. Be strategic in your rolls to avoid rolling a 1 and losing half your score.
